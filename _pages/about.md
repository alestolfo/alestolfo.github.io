Hi! I am a doctoral student in the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch) at [ETH Z端rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I am advised by Prof. [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://www.mrinmaya.io).

<!--- My work includes... --->

I am interested in studying and improving **machine learning models** for **natural language processing**. I am excited about exploring their capabilities on complex tasks such as solving arithmetic problems and reasoning over factual and commonsense knowledge.

Before starting my doctoral studies, I obtained a Master's degree in Data Science at ETH Z端rich,
and I worked at [Rethink-Resource](https://rethink-resource.com) on the development of [Circado](https://rethink-resource.com/circado). <!--- a sustainable trading platform for secondary resources. --->
I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it). 

<!--- I am broadly interested in investigating the capabilities of machine learning models for natural language processing such as reasoning, memorization, and temporal generalization. --->

<!--- You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. --->

<!--- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->

I am grateful to be a recipient of the [CYD Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/research/services/fund-research/funding-opportunities/fellowship-mobility/cyd-fellowships/awarded-cyd-fellows/).
